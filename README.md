The goal is to create a client-side application to consume an API and to show its data in the user profile. This application must work on the latests browsers.

![Layout](layout.jpg)

[PSD file](https://github.com/AndersonMamede/challenge-b2w-user-profile/blob/master/layout-psd.psd) is also available.

This is the [API endpoint](http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a5e38f3330000b0261923a5).

## Requirements

* Use a CSS preprocessor, preferably Sass (feel free to use a CSS lib/framework)
* Application must have great user experience, no matter the device
* You can use Angular or React
* Create a build of your project in a folder called 'dist'
* Don't forget to add instructions on how to deploy and run your project
